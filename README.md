# Overview
Through this project, the design pattern Iterator has been demonstrated. The Iterator provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. The project is a Cricket Scorecard which in turn depicts the design pattern. Users can access/view the scores of each player without actually knowing the actual implementation of the scorecard, which is an aggregate object.  
# Design
The project defines an interface IPlayerIterator which assists in the traversal of the aggregate object, the list of Players. The PlayerIterator class implements this interface.
